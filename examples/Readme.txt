Example list:
  
  Ex1: Ex1 in http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3/sdpexample.html
    data format: A1.txt, C1.txt, b1.txt

  Ex2: Ex2 in http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3/sdpexample.html

  Ex3: Example 2.11 in p.11 of the book “Semidefinite Optimization and Convex Algebraic Geometry”

  Ex4: Example 2.14 with alpha=1 in p.14 of the book “Semidefinite Optimization and Convex Algebraic Geometry”

  Ex5: from Jon with alpha = 0.1, only for feasibility test (dual), so bfile is unnecessary

  Ex6: from Jon with alpha = csrt(2), only for feasibility test (dual), so bfile is unnecessary
